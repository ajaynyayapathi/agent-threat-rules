# ADOPTERS

Projects and organizations that have integrated Agent Threat Rules (ATR) into
public, ongoing work. Inclusion here is self-declared by the adopter via PR
and reflects the state at the time of the merge. Entries are sorted by
adoption tier and then alphabetically. The maintainers reserve the right to
move an entry between tiers if its public status changes (e.g. a project is
archived) — entries are not removed without notice.

To add yourself, open a PR using the
[`adopter` PR template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/adopter.md). The
maintainers do not pre-approve adoption — your PR becomes the record.

## Why this file exists

ADOPTERS.md is the **machine-readable source of truth** consumed by
`agentthreatrule.org/ecosystem` and by downstream tooling that wants to know
which projects ship ATR. The website renders this file directly; the file is
not a marketing artefact and must not contain marketing copy.

Each entry follows a fixed structure (see Schema below) so the website can
parse it without ambiguity.

---

## Schema

Each entry, regardless of tier, follows:

```markdown
### Project Name
- **Org**: organisation (or "Independent")
- **Type**: one of [engine | rule-import | category-subset | adapter | reference | sidecar-proxy | other]
- **Integration**: one-sentence description of what the integration is
- **Evidence**: link to the merged PR / public announcement / docs page
- **Since**: YYYY-MM-DD (date of public adoption)
- **Status**: one of [shipped | in-review | planning]
- **Categories** (optional): comma-separated list of ATR categories the
  project consumes (e.g. `prompt-injection`, `tool-poisoning`)
```

The website parser reads the four required fields. Optional fields may be
added but parsers ignore unknown keys.

## Tier S — Standards bodies & frameworks

Adopters whose adoption is itself a public-good interoperability artefact
(taxonomies, catalogues, profiles, schemas published by neutral bodies).

## Removed entries

If an adopter is moved out of an active tier due to project archival, removal
of ATR support, a closed/unmerged PR, or unverifiable evidence, the entry is
noted here with the reason and the original "Since" date preserved.

- **IBM mcp-context-forge** (was Tier 2 · since 2026-05-09) — evidence PR IBM/mcp-context-forge#4109 was closed without merge. Removed 2026-06-14.
- **Portkey AI Gateway** (was Tier 2 · since 2026-05-16) — evidence PR Portkey-AI/gateway#1652 was closed without merge. Removed 2026-06-14.
- **Semgrep** (was Tier 2 · since 2026-05-10) — no merged PR or verifiable evidence link could be located. Removed 2026-06-14.
- **Puliczek/awesome-mcp-security** (was Tier 3 · since 2026-04-21) — ATR is not present in the project README; listing could not be verified. Removed 2026-06-14.
- **aaif-goose (block/goose)** (was Tier 2 · since 2026-05-19) — evidence PR aaif-goose/goose#9304 is goose's generic PreToolUse denial hook; the PR body does not reference ATR, so it is not an ATR-specific integration. Removed 2026-06-16.
- **Google ADK** (was Tier 2 · since 2026-06-16) — the samples PR google/adk-python#6130 was closed without merge, so this entry was removed 2026-07-05. The docs integration landed separately in google/adk-docs#1850 and Google ADK is listed again under Tier 2 from that evidence.
- **NVIDIA garak** (was Tier 2 · since 2026-05-20) — evidence PR NVIDIA/garak#1676 was closed without merge on 2026-08-04, withdrawn by its author after four months in changes-requested. Removed 2026-08-23.
- **OpenAI Guardrails** (was Tier 2 · since 2026-06-16) — evidence PR openai/openai-guardrails-python#77 was closed without merge by an OpenAI maintainer on 2026-08-18, who recommended a separately maintained integration instead. Removed 2026-08-23.
- **TalEliyahu/Awesome-AI-Security** (was Tier 3 · since 2026-04-10) — the listing was merged but is no longer present in the project README; it was removed upstream some time before 2026-05-09. Removed 2026-08-23.
